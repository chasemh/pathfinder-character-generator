# pathfinder-character-generator
A simple Ruby based character generator for the Pathfinder Role-Playing Game.

## How to Use

Characters may be generated by running the `scripts/Driver.rb`.
The program will walk you through the character generation process.

```bash
cd /path/to/pathfinder-character-generator
ruby scripts/Driver.rb
# or
./scripts/Driver.rb
```

Once your character is complete, it will be saved to `pathfinder-character-generator/generated_characters/<file_name>`

top level of this repo.

```bash
cd /path/to/pathfinder-character-generator
rdoc
```
